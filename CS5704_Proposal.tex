% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

%\boldmath
Code clone detection remains an active topic in software enginnering. It is not only common in the programming process, but also leading to low maintainability. 
In this paper, we propose a simple and fast tool to detect cloned codes, basing on the token frequency in source code. Our tool extracts variables in each block, performs pretreatment on them, as well as counts keywords and symbols. After transforming these pieces of information into lists, different weights are given to these components, then a similarity comparision algorithm is developed to find out similar codes. 
As a counting-based detection tool, it compares lists of names and numbers instead of source code directly, so we can expect less time cost compared to other detection tools. Also components have different weights, thus accuracy can be maintained to some extent.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

It is very common that people clone codes, i.e. reuse some code fragments by copying with or without modification in the coding process. 
Previous research shows a significant fraction of the code being cloned even in some well-known software systems. The fraction of duplicated code in X Windows System is about 19\%, while in some core parts of Linux the number is between 15\% and 25\%. 
Even if code clone can improve the efficiency of the program in some ways, for example, reducing execution time for no need to call the same function again and again, it is quite difficult for developers to maintain a software in its life cycle: if adding or cutting a feature, fixing a bug, it has to be applied to all the similar parts. To solve this problem, clone detection has become an important tool for programmers: it's much easier if provided all the copied parts when making a change.

There are four kinds of clones based on the variation of codes, first simply whitespace, layout and comments, then identifiers, literals and type, more comes with changed, added or removed statements, and finally is the same computation in different ways.  
A number of tools have been implemented, using various algorithms to find out clones. Those tools can be based on texts, tokens, trees and graphs. Among all the techniques and tools, token-based method performs well in both clone type detection and time cost.

However every tool has its own limitations, just like the huge time cost of CCFinder. Then we provoked our project, to develop and implement a scalable clone detection based on tokens to detect the first three types of code clone, i.e. textual clone. 
While many researchers have done similar job before, our tool is new: with the description of clone types, developers would not make dramatic changes in code clone process except for some modifications such as types, identifiers and statements. 
Based on this premise, we try to design and improve a classification statistical method to calculate the similarity between code fragments. Specifically, to detect whether fragment A is a clone of fragment B or not, we use a parser to catch all the tokens in the two fragments, and compare the frequencies of them.

The more detailed idea is like below:
first the source code will be divided into fragments, for each fragment, any useful tokens, such as types, variables, identifiers, operators, will be counted, so the information is transformed into a list of names and numbers. 
Next is pretreatment of variable names, take fragments A and B, compare and find out similar variables using n-gram, here we assume that in actual cases, which usually contain a large amount of codes, variable names have to make sense, which means, no a's and b's, but something like StudentName and ClassAverage.
After finding matching variable names, we can compare the list, by putting different weights on different tokens, the accuracy is enhanced, and this similarity algorithm can be improved after actual testing.
Finall is setting up the threshold, which can also be decided after actual testing.

Our tool has its own advantages: the first part of this process is just counting, which has very low time cost; the next part is to find out similar variable names, which is the most time-consuming part in our process, but is still not complicated; the last part is to compare lists of names and numbers, which is simple math and pretty straightforward. For the whole process, we can expect low time cost.

For a counting based detection tool with low time cost, the accuracy can still be maintained to some extent, in our algorithm, the weighting part does contribute.

Our solution is new and we believe it's aggressive in clone detection field.


\section{Background}

To detect cloned codes, the first thing is to know clone types: there are two main kinds of similarity between code fragments. The first kind has textual similarity, and often comes from copying and pasting. Textual similarity can fall into three types: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Type 1 simply includes the variations in whitespace, layout and comments. 
\item Type 2 allows more variations in identifiers, literals and types, in addition to Type 1.
\item Type 3 contains Type 2 and allows further modifications such as changed, added or removed statements. 
\end{itemize}

An example of Type 1, 2, 3 clones is shown in Fig \ref{fig:TOC}. 

The second main kind is functional similarity. Functional similarity is described by Type 4 clone, or semantic clone, which is more complicated. 
\begin{itemize}
\item In Type 4 code fragments perform the same computation but are implemented in different ways. 
\end{itemize}

Few tools have been developed to detect Type 4 clones so far.\\


\begin{figurehere}
\centering \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{graph2_1} \caption{Types of Clone} \label{fig:TOC}
\end{figurehere}

Based on the cloned types, researchers have developed different techniques and tools. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Text based, which means comparing whole lines to each other textually. 
\item Token based, it is still line-based comparision, but each sequence is summarized by a functor that abstracts the identifiers and literals, this encoding process preserves the structure of the whole sentence.
\item Metric based, by gathering different metrics for code fragments, these metric vectors are compared.
\item Tree based, usually means the abstract syntax trees(AST), a program is transformed into an abstract syntax tree, then the leaves and subtrees are compared.
\item Graph based, for example, program dependency graphs(PDG), control and data flow dependencies of a function can be represented by a program dependency graph, and comparision of subgraphs will be performed.
\end{itemize}

There are also other techniques but will not be discussed here.
Among all the techniques and tools, token-based method performs well in both clone type detection and time cost.


\section{Related Work}

Many token-based methods have been developed, like CCFinder\cite{CCFinder}, CMCD\cite{CMCD},  Boreas\cite{Boreas}, RTF\cite{RTF}. 

CCFinder is a classical tool, it first makes a parameter-replacement, like replaces identifiers with a token, and compares each code portion to all other portions. This is very long and detailed comparision, which results in a high accuracy, however that could also costs a huge amount of time.

CMCD uses Count Matrix, it counts many aspects for each variable, and constructs a count vector for that variable, then the count vectors are compared to find out corresponding variables. This method works well in extracting variables those are copied but in different names, but is doesn't include other contributions, like keywords and symbols.

Boreas is based on CMCD, it uses CMCD to compare variables, as well as taking keywords and symbols into account, but still has room for improvement, both in executing time, and detection accuracy. 

RTF uses flexible tokenization, but it doesn't use acess modifiers like \textbf{private, protected, public} and type names \textbf{int, short, long, float, double}, so it loses a lot of imformation.
